# Tech-Academy-C-Projects
This is my repository of all the C# projects I completed under the Tech Academy's C# & .NET Framework bootcamp.

So notable entries include:

TwentyOne Game:
https://github.com/DustyDood/Tech-Academy-CSharp-Projects/tree/main/TwentyOne

This is a version of blackjack run as a console app. Utilizing MVC, this app allows for a user to enter a casino, bring along an initial amount of money, and bet on each hand. The code involves error handling, logic, polymorphism, and reading/writing to a database through Entity Framework, among other things. 

Scores:
https://github.com/DustyDood/Tech-Academy-CSharp-Projects/tree/main/Scores

An introduction to .NET Core, Scores is a simple console application that accesses a file located in the project folder, reads it, then writes relevant information to the console window. 

Actual Server Time: 
https://github.com/DustyDood/Tech-Academy-CSharp-Projects/tree/main/ActualServerTime

A work in progress, this is an MVC .NET Core application that has been pushed to Azure. Right now, loading the page will simple tell the time that you loaded the page. For the future, I want to practice asynchonus calls with await and async. 

Car Insurance App: 
https://github.com/DustyDood/Tech-Academy-CSharp-Projects/tree/main/CarInsurance

This is a simple application that was further practice with MVC. User information is entered into the website, which is then stored in a database thanks to Entity Framework. The information entered helps calculate a quote for the prospective customer. Also, there is an Admin Controller/View (passed through a ModelView) that shows the (theoretical) first name, last name, e-mail address, and quote for all customers.
